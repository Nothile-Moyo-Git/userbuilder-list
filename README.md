This was a passion project and a test to check if I truly understood the React fundamentals. As well as an opportunity to keep exploring improvements to my CSS skills.

This included states, useEffect, React lifecyclces, a clear understanding of the DOM and DOM manipulated, as well as ES6 JavaScript ( maps and filters ) on top of improving my Object Oriented programming and architecture skills
