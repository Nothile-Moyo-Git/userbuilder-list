This is my Userbuilder list. It's similar to a to-do list but it contains users.

This project was completely written by me, and is a test of my understanding of React fundamentals.

This included states, useEffect, React lifecyclces, a clear understanding of the DOM and DOM manipulated, as well as ES6 JavaScript ( maps and filters ) on top of improving my Object Oriented programming and architecture skills

NOTE: PLEASE VISIT MASTER BRANCH IN ORDER TO SEE THE CODE
