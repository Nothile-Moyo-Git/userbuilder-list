React - user management project
This project will take an age and a username
It displays this in a grid below the input box
If the input is wrong, we display a card which informs the user of how to enter a correct input
text example is: 
Please enter a valid name
Please enter a valid name and age
Please enter an age > 0

So, current plan
1: Create a new react component from Scratch and load this - done
2: Create a components folder - done
3: Create UserBuilder/UserList components in this folder
3.1: Create the structure and definitions - done
3.2: Style them as well
3.3: Add any compensation styling ( backgrounds etc.. )
4: Create an error folder in components and build this component there
5: Style this component to be below the form for now before dealing with output
6: Manage our inputs and use CourseInput as an example of how we can store data
6.1: I think we do this by using a spread operator on a state and adding the entries to it
6.2: So we need a state in app.js which we can update using two way binding - test this thoroughly
7: Execute added functionality for showing/hiding the box and also outputting an array of user information 

This means we need
1: UserBuilder component / css
2: UserList component / css ( These two can share a folder )
3: ErrorModal component / css
4: UserBuilder and UserList to be in App.js for two way binding
5: Error modal to be in User Builder so we get the right input

UserBuilder component has the form inside it and the error modal which displays based on state
UserList component which displays our form outputs from App.js
Errormodal which goes inside UserBuilder, we show or hide this based on a state ( animate this )
Use cool gradients for the button and the logo title, improve on his styling significantly
